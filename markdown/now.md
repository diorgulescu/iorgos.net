## What I'm doing NOW

+ Ever-learning (and working with) embedded devices, microcontrollers and Linux 
+ Lifting kettlebells, training for Kettlebell Sport (aka Girevoy Sport) and doing my best to do some form of physical training each day
+ Actively using my Lenovo Thinkpad T61 for my personal work, and it's also kind of a daily driver.
+ Tinkering with LaTeX

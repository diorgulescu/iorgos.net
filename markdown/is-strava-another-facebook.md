## Is Strava just another Facebook?

*9.07.2019 (revised in 2023)*

Well, of course it’s not. Not really. Or, maybe just a bit.

It would appear as dumb or superficial to think that Strava is just another Facebook, targeted at a different audience. Especially since, for example, “posting” something to your Strava profile generally requires that some form of physical activity has been performed (be it running, swimming, walking, cycling, strength training, yoga, etc.). This makes it more of a social network for sports enthusiasts, which is really cool. I've used it myself, on and off, for a while. And I still have a profile there, somewhere (it was synced with Polar Flow, since I used Polar devices).

Now, being me, I’m constantly undergoing some sort of self-evaluation, trying to analyze my own behavior as best as I can. This led me aboard an intriguing train of thought that I’ll try to detail next.

Facebook generally serves as a platform for satisfying very deep needs in regards to social interaction and validation. By it's very nature, interaction is merely virtual, so only validations through “Likes” remain. It is also an ideal way to fill up voids within yourself and your life. The thin line between sharing and desperately bragging is ever more blurry nowadays, and every time we feel the urge to post a photo of an intimate moment (dinner with our children, celebrating an anniversary with our spouse at a nice resort, being on vacation at a popular spot and so on) we must ask ourselves:

+ “Why do I get the urge to post something about this wonderful thing I am living right now?”
+ “Why do I need others to know exactly what my kid drew for my birthday?”
+ “Is it vital to take a carefully crafted photo of us as a couple living an ideal and romantic life and sharing it with the world? Are we missing something that could be covered by *Likes* from our friends and relatives?”

If sharing interesting articles, events and photos of landscapes or landmarks may be perfectly understandable (as a way to popularize them or share some of that beauty with others), publicly sharing photos of private and personal moments is intriguing. And I believe there is a true fear in tackling this deep subject and finding out what are we trying to compensate by engaging in such weird and paradoxical behaviors. Because yes, it is a paradox. Think of all the people yelling about online privacy issues while voluntarily sharing their own private moments and data.

So, can Strava also fill up a void? After all, replacing *"Likes"* with *"Kudos"* doesn't change a thing when compared to Facebook. Could a similar urge lie beyond simply sharing sport activities and using the platform as an advanced performance evaluation tool (for example, observing your progress on a 10 kilometer run over time is quite interesting and useful, especially when combined with heart rate analysis)? Is it possible that we sometimes want to show others that we’re still alive and that we still matter? “Look, I’m here! I can still run a half-marathon!”. Do we always engage in tracked physical activities for our own sake, or for getting online feedback? Are Garmin Connect, Polar Flow and all the rest not enough for tracking personal progress?

Is it possible for Strava to make you feel bad about yourself, just like Facebook might when you look at other people’s “tidy, ideal, happy lives”? Could one feel bad for gaining weight due to constraints on available leisure time (because of child care or professional duties, for example) and/or lack of discipline, while other people in the Strava feed keep cycling 80+ kilometers a day or constantly run 10 kilometers three times a week? Would a woman that just gave birth develop depression while looking at activities posted by her friends (things she also enjoyed doing just before deciding to have a child), feeling that her life might be over and that she will never be able to get back in shape and enjoying the luxury of physical activity and self-care? Especially if those Strava entries have some photos attached to them. Well, it might. Then again, it is not the platform's fault and it's all just a matter of getting your life together, no matter what hurdles you face.

But (yet another) *digital alter-ego* will never be the cure to one's problems or the optimal way to instill some good-old self discipline. On the contrary, striving to "compete" on Strava might end up being bad for your health, just because you might push yourself way beyond your current healthy limits, without a structured approach (run at a very high heart rate for extended periods of time, going downhill at 70 kmh on a bicycle just so you can set a personal record, overtraining without proper recovery, etc.). I've been there and I've done that. 
 
After all, our life is ours alone. When it comes to health & fitness, we should compete with ourselves above all, since that drives improvement over the long run by forcing you to reshape your habits and perceptions. Seeing and feeling your own progress and increase in wellbeing is priceless when compared to trivial digital interactions (which are, most of the time, forced or fake - but no one dares to admit that). Once you've got all that going, get out in the world and try to "compete" and compare with people you consider to be role-models. See where you're at, redefine your goals (if necessary), keep your discipline and march on. Things will get even better, with patience and perseverence. And for all that, a simple sportswatch, a paper notebook and a pen would suffice.  

Our private moments are unique. By constantly thinking about immediately sharing them with the world and getting anxious about the positive feedback we will receive on a social media site, we are truly missing out. But we do so on our own existence, by voluntarily devaluing it, bit by bit, photo by photo, share by share.

So, next time you go out for a run/bike ride/whatever, don't track it with Strava. You may use a heart rate monitor or any device that helps you keep track of your health, but don't share the session anywhere. How does that make you feel? If "Oh, God! But how will the world know I went out today?!" pops in your mind, then you might have a problem. What makes you think the world cares about your daily routines? Are you THAT important? Should the world care, instead of seeing you looking healthy when they meet you face-to-face?

What happened to storytelling?

   P.S.: Mind you, I'm not bashing fitness trackers or Strava. They're fine for what they were initially designed to do, but I think Strava "gamifies" too much when it comes to health.

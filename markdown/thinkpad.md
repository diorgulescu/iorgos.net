# Why I still use an old Thinkpad laptop

## Preamble

The first computer I've ever layed my eyes on was an inciting HC-90 (an old Z80 clone developed in Romania during the late '80s). I still remember the day I got it, thanks to my father who rescued it from going to the trash. 

You see, it was 1998 and I was a 5th-grader that liked playing around with cardboard boxes in the livingroom, and those boxes were computers in my imagination. I remember seeing movies on TV where computers appeared here and there, rendering me both curious and fascinated. Even drew a make-belief keyboard on one box and pretended to type. My parents thought I might be on to something, and since our family was barely making end's meat months on end, there was simply not a chance to gather enough money for buying even the simplest computer. However, my dad was working as some sort of a handy-man at a local school, and that school had just decommissioned their old computer in favor of a brand new PC (a classic Intel 4086). It just so happened my dad was around that afternoon, during summer vacation. Finding out the device was destined for the trash bin, he kindly asked if he could take it home. The school administrator agreed, since they were about to throw it out anyways. A few hours later, Lo and Behold: my dad came home with two large bags and a box (hauling that through public transport must've been quite the chore for him). Sadly, I don't have any old photos of that, but online archives contain quite a number of those:

I realized that computer was nothing like the "shinny" ones that were slowly coming into Romania at that time, but a more rudimentary tool. It came with a 12 inch CRT monochrome display and a separate floppy disk unit. The computer itself was inside the keyboard (much like the current-day RaspberryPi 400 - link), and some user manuals were also available (and thank God for that, because it meant the world to me!). I also got two floppy disks with three or four games, which were pretty fun. 

Once the computer booted up, the user was greeted with a simple CLI (Command Line Interface). No fancy user interface, no dialog boxes, no mouse, nothing like that. It was just a busybox with a BASIC interpreter. One of the manuals was actually a comprehensive BASIC manual, that took you "from zero to hero", so the following weeks I started going through that, mimetically at first, gradually starting to understand how the system works and "how to give it stuff to do".

Years went by and, eventually, that computer indeed ended in the bin (though now I regret that and wish I would've kept it as a collectible item) and a PC with Windows 98 took it's place. What followed maybe subject for a different post.

But, even though nowadays we're drowned in technology (desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and all types of gadgets making up the IoT space), I still have a lot of moments I feel overwhelmed by it all. Too many browsers, websites, platforms, apps, notifications, emails, messaging applications, ads, videos, music, games and fitness trackers. 

Even professionally, I feel there's an inflation of frameworks, programming languages, operating systems, IDEs and whatnot. And as welcomed as all these are, I feel my attention gradually becoming fragmented, even though I am not a heavy social media user (heck, I even enjoy keeping my phone silent most of the time). I usually set up to perform a task, study a particular subject or write down some thoughts (like I am trying to do now), only to find myself interrupted by emails or some other notifications. One would think this is easily surpassable by disabling notifications and closing the email client, but if you get an idle moment and my mind starts wondering about, I might open the web browser and a few tabs. I admit having this issue from time to time. And it is in those moments that I remember the calmness of a different time, when it was way easier to focus on one thing alone for large chunks of time. 

## Enter the Thinkpad T61

A couple of years back, while experimenting in my tech homelab, I bought a Lenovo Thinkpad T61 (merely for the fact that it was compatible with FreeBSD & OpenBSD). Changed the battery with a new and big one, added a brand new SSD, cleaned everything up and used it for playing around with some ideas. But during that process, I became very fond of the laptop itself. The way it's built (like a tank, aimed at achieving a long life), the modularity and ease with which you can change almost everything inside it (the exact thing the Right To Repair act is supposed to fight for), the mechanical keyboard, the Night Light LED (a very nice touch, especially since the keyboard is not backlit), the famous track point and so on. Yes, the display is not FullHD, but I don't need it to be. 

As time went by, I began treating it more like a almost "daily driver" moreso than a homelab piece meant for mindless experimentation. And, gradually, it kinda became one. 

## My Setup

I run Debian Linux (12.0/bookworm, the latest at the time of writing). It's familiar, unpretentious, very stable and allows one to go light on the resource hogging aspect modern desktops bring. XFCE4 Desktop is installed, but mostly for some additional GTK+ tools and system applets that make life easier, and for being able to run every graphical program I need. Because, actually, I am using a rather minimal window manager called i3. This has been around for many years, gradually evolving.

Interestingly, my Thinkpad came with a docking station, which I have linked to my livingroom monitor (using a DVI-to-HDMI adapter). That serves as a charging station, external peripherals (keyboard and mouse) and Ethernet.

### What do I get out of it?

### Programs I use on it

+ i3 (window manager / graphical UI)
+ xterm (terminal / command line)
+ Claws EMail (graphical email client, very capable and lightweight)
+ texlive (LaTeX package for document authoring - learning about this gem whenever I get the time)
+ mpv (video & audio player)
+ Min (an Electron-based minimalistic browser that looks awesome and helps getting rid of distractions)
+ lynx (console web browser - I still use this for some readings and I like making sure my websites are perfectly readable in this manner, too)
+ vim (console editor with lots of features; maybe I am too acoustumed to it after all these years, since I use it for editing mostly anything, from text notes, to source code and LaTeX documents)
+ git
+ tig (console-based Git history browser)
+ hugo (static website generator - for kettlebell.ro)
+ mkws.sh (another static website generator, used for this very website you're reading now)
+ Midnight Commander - mc (console file manager; like the old Norton Commander or the present day Total Commander, but for Linux; used also for transferring files with remote hosts)
+ feh (setting custom wallpapers)
+ Inkscape & GIMP (image editing and vector graphics)

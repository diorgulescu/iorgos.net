# What I'm currently up to
Check out my now page.

# Journal (blog)
From time to time, I enjoy writting down thoughts or small technical howtos.

# Sounds
Played some bass guitar, drums and synthesizer over the years, ranging from odd metal to experimental electronica. I have a few recordings of my own, and a full list is available on my Sounds page.

# Projects

A few things I am (or was) involved in:
+ DAMF (Device Automation & Management Framework)
The goal here is to provide software test engineers and test lab managers/maintainers with a free & open system that makes it easy to manage embedded devices (boards, prototypes & other devices from the embedded universe) while also running automated test suites and generating test reports. This was initially inspired by an older version of Linaro's LAVA system.
+ Suckless Ubuntu
A small project that started out as a set of scripts I used for setting up a working Ubuntu-based Linux system tailored to my way of working. It relies on tools developed by suckless.org (dwm, dmenu, slstatus, surf, etc.). It's based on a minimal Ubuntu 18.04 installation (using the mini.iso image) which offers just the barebones of a system. Some testing to be done on 20.04 (things have changed and the mini.iso is not being officially built anymore).

# Contact me
Well, I don't really use traditional social media, so you can find me on Mastodon. I rely on email as my main way of online interaction. Of course, there's also a LinkedIn profile, but that's clearly job-oriented.

So, if you want to get in touch, I'd be more than happy to do that via email. I do read my emails, but it sometimes can take a while for me to respond (due to never-ending time constraints).

# Drago»ô Iorgulescu

## Who am I
+ Husband and father of two boys
+ Keen on sports and physical activities: bicycle touring, hiking, running, kettlebell lifting (mostly Kettlebell Sport), heavy club swinging, weightlifting and calisthenics. 
+ Fond of Open Source & Free software, with a soft spot for embedded devices and old Lenovo Thinkpad laptops. I like using Linux, tmux & vim (either natively or in WSL2 on Windows), even for my personal computing needs (even though there are times when I still resort to more commonly used software - Adobe Lightroom, MS Office and the likes). I do my best to not be dogmatic about "software schools of thought".
+ Amateur trainspotter and trains enthusiast (I prefer trains as my main mid- to long-distance means of transportation)

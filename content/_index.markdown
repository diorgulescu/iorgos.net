# Dragoș Iorgulescu

## Who am I
+ Husband and father
+ Keen on sports and physical activities: bicycle touring, hiking, running, kettlebell lifting (mostly Kettlebell Sport), heavy club swinging, weightlifting and calisthenics. 
+ Fond of Open Source & Free software, with a soft spot for embedded devices and old Lenovo Thinkpad laptops. I like using Linux, tmux & vim (either natively or in WSL2 on Windows), even for my personal computing needs (even though there are times when I still resort to more commonly used software - Adobe Lightroom, MS Office and the likes). I do my best to not be dogmatic about "software schools of thought".
+ Amateur trainspotter and trains enthusiast (I prefer trains as my main mid- to long-distance means of transportation, whenever possible)

## What this site is about

It's simply a personal web space, where I scribble notes and thoughts. Some of the posts are in Romanian (my native tongue). This includes the *"Kettlebell"* section, which is mostly targeted towards fellow Romanians (resources on the matter are realy scarce here), aiming at popularising the kettlebell as a versatile training tool for people of all ages, occupations and time constraints.

If you wish to contact me, please do so via e-mail, as it is my preferred way of digital interaction.

Thanks for stopping by! 
All the best!

Dragoș

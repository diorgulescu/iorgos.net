A discreet homelab, hidden away from curious toddlers' hands</p>

<p>This was also the largest one, of course. I was overly-enthusiastic and didn’t really have any precise goals. A Raspberry Pi cluster was also included, because I found the idea to be very fascinating and cool.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 x Atrust Intel-based thin client (an older, refurbished and fanless machine)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x SuperMicro A1SAi mini-server based on the A1SRi-2358F motherboard, running VMWare ESXi (hosting an instance of pfSense that takes care of routing and LAN segments)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x Proxmox VE Server (this is my former desktop that got converted to a server), based on an AMD Ryzen 5 CPU with 32 GB DDR4 &amp; almost 1 TB SSD storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x Dell OptiPlex 3050 Micro (7th gen i5, 8 GB DDR4, Windows 10 Pro) acting as a media &amp; file server (it’s linked to the TV and it also runs a Syncthing server to which our mobile phones upload photos - instead of relying on Google Photos, OneDrive, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v7 (my 10-year old WiFi router, now running OpenWRT and taking care of the wireless network associated with the lab)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 x Zyxel 5-port Gigabit managed switch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Building the first lab</p>
<p>I first took the Supermicro server, cleaned it up and placed it in the bottom drawer of a simple IKEA living room organizer. I actually dismantled the back of the drawer (made of pretty solid plastic) in order to have access to all ports and help with ventilation.

<p>I placed the power sockets on top of it in a manner that doesn’t cover the server’s fans. I use two separate multiple socket thingies, each with an ON/OFF button. One of them is for the Raspberry Pi cluster, because I want to be able to shut that thing off when I’m not actively working with it.

<p>Time to get down on my knees and make the cable mess less messy.

<p>Insert all cables and give it a go. Boy, that does sound good!

<p>The ex-desktop (now server) running Proxmox VE can be seen in the third photo</p>
<h4 id="what-did-i-use-it-for">What did I use it for?</h4>
<p>Well, the Supermicro server had VMWare ESXi installed on it. pfSense ran in a VM and was binded to three physical NICs on the server (named WAN, LAB &amp; CLUSTER). This VM handled Internet traffic coming through from the crappy router provided by my ISP. I also ran a few other lightweight VMs on this server, like Pi-hole &amp; Alpine Linux.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pis were used for learning Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, k3s/Rancher and toying around with NetBSD’s Kyua/ATF (an automated testing framework for Net &amp; FreeBSD - this was done on the RPi 2s). One of the RPis ran VMWare ESXi for ARM, for testing &amp; more (lighter) virtualization. The Atrust thin client was linked to the cluster and it was mainly used as a machine for coordinating the boards (Ansible &amp; the like).</p>
<p>Dell OptiPlex 3050 Micro is a great mini-PC that’s used as a media center (on Windows 10 Pro) for streaming services. It also ran Syncthing (which we used at the time, before moving to NextCloud).</p>
<p>Finally, the Proxmox VE server was used for more hardcore virtualization, mainly for studying/re-learning Windows &amp; UNIX servers at a more “business-like” level (Directory Services in mixed environments, unattended Windows deployments, Hyper-V administration, etc.).
Why did I move on?</p>
<p>Well, the Raspberry Pi cluster was too much of a mess for my taste. The RPi 4 gets WAY too hot so coolers were on almost 24/7 and I quickly noticed that, for my needs, the same computing power could be achieved with computers that did not require such complexity. After this, I replaced the cluster with two Dell Wyse mini-PCs.</p>

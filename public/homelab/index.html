<h1 id="my-homelab">My Homelab</h1>
<h2 id="why-on-earth-would-i-even-bother-to-build-one">Why on Earth would I even bother to build one?</h2>
<p>Because I really love playing around with various devices, testing out configurations and learning new stuff along the way. The thought of building my own “playground”/homelab occurred to me some years ago, but I’ve only just now got motivated enough to actually go ahead &amp; build it (Thanks COVID-19!).</p>
<p>Since I live in a relatively small 2-bedroom apartment with extremely curious little boys, space constraints are a given (so are child safety “gadgets”, here and there). Hence my discreet living room setup. The weird diagram is an attempt at illustrating how everything is configured at the moment.</p>
<p>Over the last year, I went through three “incarnations” of this homelab. The first one was the most complex, but gradually moved towards simpler setups for various reasons (datailed below), as I began to define clear goals for myself.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-a-homelab">Purpose of a homelab</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have FUN!</li>
<li>Learn/Re-learn/Consolidate some networking knowledge (from a Systems Admin’s standpoint)</li>
<li>Learn Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform &amp; other similar &ldquo;beauties&rdquo;</li>
<li>Play with &amp; Learn NetBSD’s ATF (Automated Testing Framework)/Kyua(ATF 2.0), which is also available on FreeBSD</li>
<li>Revisit &amp; Update knowledge on LDAP (AD &amp; OpenLDAP)</li>
<li>Deploy virtual network environments in order to prepare &amp; learn for future certification exams</li>
<li>Experiment a lot</li>
<li>Have MORE FUN!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mainly worked as a Software Test Engineer (and have been for 15 years), but I also occasionally take care of test labs/environments and I plan on picking a different career path (oriented on DevOps &amp; Cybersecurity). I do have an itch for embedded systems, a bit of programming, obscure operating systems &amp; BSDs. Therefore this setup is quite useful for learning (especially for my future certification exams).</p>
<h2 id="current-setup">Current setup</h2>
<p>image</p>
<p>This one is “stable” at the moment, in the sense that I don’t feel a need to expand it even further. You could say I’m turning into some sort of a minimalist.
Hardware checklist</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x Dell OptiPlex 3050 Mini (8 GB RAM, Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500T CPU @ 2.70GHz, 1 nVME SSD &amp; 1 480 GB SATA III SSD) - runs Linux Mint, used as a home fileserver, NextCloud server &amp; media center (it’s connected to the TV, which is useful for YouTube and Netflix when needed)</li>
<li>2 x Seagate 4TB USB3 HDD - these are connected to the OptiPlex in a RAID1 configuration (soft RAID using mdadm) and these hold our photos, movie clips, the photos uploaded by our phones when we get home and some other stuff</li>
<li>1 x TP-Link Archer C80 - wireless router handling our home traffic</li>
<li>1 x Brother HL-1222WE monochrome laser printer (networked)</li>
<li>1 x HP ProBook 650 G4 laptop (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8850H CPU @ 2.60GHz with 6 cores and 9MB L3 cache, 32 GB DDR4 memory and a 500 GB nVME SSD) - my daily driver and powerhorse. Runs Ubuntu Linux and libvirt/qemu for virtualizing stuff needed for GNS3 labs (networking, infrastructure tests, etc.), also used for casual &amp; office activities, but also serves as a little workstation for editing photos, clips &amp; audio tracks I sometimes record.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-hardware">Additional hardware</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 x Raspberry Pi Zero W</li>
<li>1 x Texas Instruments Launchpad MSP-EXP430F5529LP (because I’m into some embedded C programming and learning a few things in this area)</li>
</ul>

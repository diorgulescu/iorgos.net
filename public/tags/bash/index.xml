      <description>Often times, while working as a Software Test Engineer, I encountered situations in which the software I was testing relied a lot on available disk space. If that wasnâ€™t the case, surely it had a way to upload files to it (either through a WEB-UI or by sending them over a certain network protocol). So, I was either going to make sure the device/machine that program ran on would end up without any available disk space at a given point in time, or try to crash the whole program by feeding it large dummy or random binary files.</description>

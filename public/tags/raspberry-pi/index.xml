      <description>My first Raspberry Pi cluster Why? I did own some Raspberry Pi boards in the past and I found them quite appealing. With the launch of the 4th generation and the rise of the whole Kubernetes ecosystem, I decided to give it a try and learn how to build a low-powered cluster using these boards. Also, Raspberry Pi 4 offers a version with 8 GB of RAM and VMWare launched a &amp;ldquo;test version&amp;rdquo; for ARM64 CPUs, therefore I had to try it.</description>

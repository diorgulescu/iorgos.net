      <description>Often times, while working as a Software Test Engineer, I encountered situations in which the software I was testing relied a lot on available disk space. If that wasn’t the case, surely it had a way to upload files to it (either through a WEB-UI or by sending them over a certain network protocol). So, I was either going to make sure the device/machine that program ran on would end up without any available disk space at a given point in time, or try to crash the whole program by feeding it large dummy or random binary files.</description>

      <description>Going &amp;ldquo;hardcore ultra-minimal&amp;rdquo; like others do might not suit you. And that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.
Well, the title might seem a bit too generic, but bare with me because I’ll try to make things clear.
A bit of history I have been using Linux for quite a long time. I first touched it during highschool and ended up learning how to dual boot my PC with Windows 2000 &amp;amp; Red Hat Linux 5 (not RHEL, but the old distro).</description>
